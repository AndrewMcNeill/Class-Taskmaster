# Taskmaster

TaskMaster is a to-do / task management application that allows you to create tasks with a chosen due date and a tag. You may organize all of your tasks through filters such as all/completed/uncompleted tasks today, tasks tomorrow, tasks within the next 7 days, aswell as by the tag names created.

Once created, a task may be selected to add a description to, as well as alter the name, due date and tags of the selected task.

A statistics page is also available to view your task completion history within the application.
